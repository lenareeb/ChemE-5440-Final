# ChemE-5440-Final

## 1. 
The majority of Problem 1 was completed by hand and is contained in [Problem-1.pdf](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Problem-1.pdf). The phase portrait was constructed by including
[ToggleMono_F1.jl](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/ToggleMono_F1.jl) which utilizes [PhasePortraitV2_F1.jl](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/PhasePortraitV2_F1.jl). The phase portrait produced can be viewed in [phase-portrait.png](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/phase-portrait.png).

## 2. 
Problem 2 parts a, b, and the majority of c can be found in [Problem-2.pdf](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Problem-2.pdf). Mathematica was used to solve for L, and R_s, and R_star,s (denoted as Rst) independent of one another, which was then used for to obtain an expression for the total level of activated receptor (denoted as Rstt) in terms of z and the given parameters. This expression was then utilized to generate the mitotic activity profile for part d. The Mathematica notebook was converted to a pdf, [Problem_2d.pdf](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Problem_2d.pdf).

## 3. 
Problem 3 part a can be found in [Problem-3.png](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Problem-3.png). The rest of problem 3 can be found in the first sheet of [Question_3&4.xlsx](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Question_3%264.xlsx), labeled Problem 3.

## 4.
The majority of Problem 2 was completed in the second sheet of [Question_3&4.xlsx](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Question_3%264.xlsx), labeled Problem 4.[Problem-4.png](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Final/blob/master/Final/Problem-4.png) contains some algebra for deriving W1 and W2 for part a.
